**Jarvis - AI Voice Assistant**

*Overview*

Jarvis is a Python-based AI voice assistant that performs various tasks, such as recognizing speech, responding via text-to-speech, retrieving stock data, automating UI interactions, and sending emails. This project leverages multiple Python libraries to enhance functionality, making it a powerful and versatile assistant.

*Features*

• Speech Recognition: Uses speech_recognition and whisper for accurate voice input processing.

• Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts text responses into speech using pyttsx3.

• Stock Market Data: Fetches real-time stock prices using yfinance.

• UI Automation: Automates keystrokes and mouse movements with pyautogui.

• Email Functionality: Sends emails via Gmail API.

• Natural Language Processing (NLP): Uses spacy for text understanding and processing.

• Graphical User Interface (GUI): Built using tkinter for user interaction.

• Multithreading: Ensures smooth performance and responsiveness.

*Requirements*

Before running jarvis.py, ensure you have the following installed:

pip install speechrecognition whisper numpy soundfile torch yfinance pyautogui google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-auth-httplib2 google-api-python-client spacy requests tkinter pyttsx3

Required API Keys

To fully utilize Jarvis, obtain the following API credentials:

•Google API Credentials (For Gmail API):

Follow Google API Console to generate credentials.json.

•OpenAI Whisper API Key (Optional for cloud-based Whisper usage):

Sign up at OpenAI if needed.

*Usage*

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/jarvis.git
